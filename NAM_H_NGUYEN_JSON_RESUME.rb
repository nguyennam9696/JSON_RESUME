We want to harness people's creative  and having-fun nature but at the same time redirect this to a good cause, charity. Darity will be the #1 go-to platform for people to dare their friends/family/celebrities, post videos where people can be filled with laughter while the crowdfunding proceeds will go to a good cause. Darity pairs up with more than 1,000 charities allowing their users to pick and choose where their proceeds can go to. Darity is built on Rails (front and back end), uses PostgreSQL as database for complex associations, PUMA as a host server for multithreading, deployed on Heroku, Twitter Oauth for tweet blasts, Action Mailers for thank-you letters and activation email verifications, and Kimono to build our own charity API."

No longer would you have to extensively research for events and no longer would you have to be solely a business/organization event. Adventures should belong to normal people like us if we want to post 'hiking buddies, college parties/events, neighborhood events, pick-up basketball games etc.' Where would you be able to find these events? Through Adventure.US, you are able to be naturally invited through push notification video messages when you are near a 1 mile radius making events more 'life dynamic and adventurous.' Adventure.US uses Google Maps API to map out all event postings with geo-fencing for zone detection, Ziggeo API for video recording and uploading, Foursquare API for category interests, and Twilio API for push notifications."

Redis is used for mem-caching and preserving data of the user's typed messages allowing it to persist even after logging out and logging back in. "

These dilation could possibly be linked to the pathological condition known as kidney stones due to the amount of absorption found here. I used Denmark's 3D viewing software and mapped each individual 0.05nm and aligned them altogether to gather and record all data."
