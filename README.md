# MY RESUME

### What Inspired Me To Make My Resume
Simple reason. I missed coding, so why not have fun applying to companies while doing it the programmer way. As I watched my colleagues type their resumes away, I took a step back and asked myself if I was the employer seeing many kinds of resumes that eventually will look all the same, I'd be fried. What if I was able to lighten up my potential employer's day with this simple resume style? And that was when the idea struck to me.

### Struggles to Overcome
My friends all tell me it is a ridiculous idea. Sometimes a person has to overcome the naysayers and do what he/she believes in.
